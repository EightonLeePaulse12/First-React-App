# First-React-App

So essentially what this is going to be is a remake of my Capstone project that I did at the end of my course at Life Choices Academy. The difference here will be that this will be done in React and not in Vue. It may not be exactly the same as I might make some changes.

This project will not just be a project, but also an opportunity for learning React as I have never used it before.

I will also be using the database that I had made for my Vue project.
